# Data & Code

There are two primary elements we deal with when programming:
data and code.

Data is any piece of digital information, and can take many forms.
This could be a spreadsheet of accounting information, a digital photograph,
an MP3 music file, or just some plain text.

Code is the actual instructions to be executed by a computer.
It runs the tax calculations on the accounting spreadsheet,
applies an effect to the photograph, boosts the bass of the MP3,
and runs linguistic analysis on the text.
