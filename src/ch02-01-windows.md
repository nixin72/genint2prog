# Windows

The following is a step-by-step guide to get a working Clojure
development environment set up on a Windows 10/11 machine.

## Java

Because Clojure runs on the JVM, we need to first install Java.
There are multiple builds and distributions of Java, however.
I recommended installing the package 'Temurin 17 (LTS)'
from [this page](https://adoptium.net/).
Side note: in software, the acronym 'LTS' refers to a
*long term support* release or version.
