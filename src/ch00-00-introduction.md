# Introduction

Welcome to *A Gentle Introduction to Interactive Programming*!
The goal of this book is to provide a straight-forward,
plain English introduction of core programming concepts, through
the use of the Clojure programming language.

Some of the concepts we'll be covering are:
- basic data types
- variables and definitions
- functions
- conditions
