This book is intended for learners new to the world of software development,
with little to no experience in programming.
In this book, we will specifically use the Clojure programming language.

Clojure's powerful *read-evaluate-print-loop* (REPL), combined with a solid
integrated development environment (IDE) in the form of Visual Studio Code
will provide learners a tight feedback loop for learning code.
This online book also features embedded interactive code snippets.
