# A Gentle Introduction to Interactive Programming

## Work In Progress!

**Readable [here](https://skinkade.github.io/genint2prog/).**

Source code for a resource intended for new learners of programming,
using the Clojure programming language,
and emphasizing interactive develop through read-evaluate-print-loops (REPLs).

Built using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

Current status:
- initial draft of ch1, which covers basic syntax,
  data types, variables and functions

Planned:
- ch2: how to install Clojure + lein + VS Code + Calva,
  prioritizing Windows setup
- example project ideas (not sure which chapter numbers):
  - passphrase generator
  - substitution cipher
  - reading a CSV and processing its data?
  - something that makes simple web requests
  - other ideas welcome!
- Long term: screencasts!
